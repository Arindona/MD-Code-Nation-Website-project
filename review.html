        <h1>Critical review of the website and the design process </h1>
<p>
        <div class="main">
<br>
<br>

            <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
            The application of the agile approach of iterative development was beneficial in the creation of the website. 
            <br>
            This allowed the final version to emerge as my knowledge and experience evolved.
            <br>
            The Backlog on the Kanban board, created in Trello, was valuable for capturing and refining new requirements as they became apparent. 
            <br>
            The Kanban board was then effective in managing the workflow.
            <br>
            Visual studio provided an effective environment for creating and editing the code.
            <br>
            The focus that was afforded by limiting the work in progress was particularly important.
            <br>
            Slack supported easy communication and collaboration, whilst both Moodle and the internet search engines provided the reference material.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
            The suggested tools such, including Slack, Trello and Visual Studio were both effective and intuitive to use.
            <br>
            This was very important as the focus of the training was maintained on the HTML and CSS, which were new to me, without being excessively distracted by having to learn the toolset.  
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
            </h2>
            Given this was my first experience of website design, HTML and CSS I was satisfied with the overall outcome.
            <br>
            I hoped to generate a format of a website rather than an answer paper and I believe I have achieved this.
            <br>
            I believe that the concept of breaking the content down into separate pages was effective in allowing the reader to navigate to the content of interest and the links have all been tested.
            <br>
            Whilst I believe the background image and transparent overlay add interest, I believe further work is required in terms of colour and contrast to aid appeal and readability. This was reinforced by the research into accessible website design.
            <br>
            The local changes to the background and text in order to add emphasis also require attention to provide a coherent appearance.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
            In addition to the enhancements to the website, described above, I would also revise the layout of the HTML and CSS code.
            <br>
            The addition of comments and a consistent indentation structure would significantly aid peer reviews and debugging.
            <br>
            Additional comments in the CSS file would also simplify the selection of the classes for additional pages with a simple description of their intent.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
            Having reviewed the Checklist I believe I have provided the required information in a format that demonstrates the learning outcomes.
            <br>
            The decision to present it in a website format as opposed to numbered answers may make the specific responses more difficult to find. The selection of the layout was a conscious choice, recognising the compromise and I hope the names of the links provide sufficient guidance to signpost the material.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review)
            <br>
            Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems
        </h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
                productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
            </h2>
            
            Where the methods such as Kanban, hence the use of Trello, stand ups etc is found to be ineffective, it is usually due to a lack of knowledge of the fundamental lean concepts and hence the purpose. This tends to result in a lack of engagement and hence benefit.
            <br>
            The application of the ‘Lean Agile’ principles as defined in methodologies such as SAFe [11] significantly enhance collaboration and effectiveness and are supported by a range of proprietary IT environments.
            <br>
            Concepts such as continuous integration are required for complex environments, where multiple developers are iterating the software concurrently. This is the practice of merging the working versions of individual developer’s code to a shared mainline at frequent intervals i.e. several times a day. Tools such as Bamboo support this and integrate with workflow environments such as Jira to ensure effective collaboration.  
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2></h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
            
            There is a paradox between productivity, i.e. effectiveness and the efficiency paradigm. Traditional management targets high utilisation as a measure of efficiency, but this frequently results in a lot of ‘work in progress’ and long queues.
            <br>
            The art of productivity relies on effective prioritisation and innovation. The emphasis needs to be changed to achieving high business impact by producing valuable outcomes with the minimum amount of activity. 
            <br>
            The visibility and limitation of work in progress afforded by the Kanban boards also plays a significant role in this respect.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
            Whilst this was an individual project, both the productivity and quality of the resultant website would have been enhanced by increased collaboration in the form of more regular demonstration and feedback.
            <br>
            Slack provides a valuable platform for collaboration, but as suggested in the agile manifesto[16], there is no substitute for face to face contact.
            <br>
            In this environment, the peer review would need to be based on mutual benefit and respect given the constrained time frame.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
            There are various strategies for testing software. These can be categorised as ‘functional’, where the software is tested against the requirements to ensure it provides the desired outcomes and ‘non functional’ tests which focus on the operational aspects[22].
            <br>
            Functional tests include:
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li>Unit testing</li>
            <li>Integration testing</li>
            <li>System testing</li>
            <li>Acceptance testing</li>
            </ul>
            Examples of non functional tests include:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Performance testing</li>
                <li>Security testing</li>
                <li>Usability testing</li>
                <li>Compatibility testing</li>
        </ul>
            <br>
            The testing of the website was focused on the functional tests, in particular a simplified form of unit tests was performed to ensure the individual components the software code performed as intended. This included checking the operation of the links, presentation of images and compatibility with alternative browsers. A limited amount of user testing was conducted by demonstrating the solution to other students and responding to feedback.
            <br>
            Where changes were made, regression tests were performed to ensure the existing code wasn’t impaired.
            <br>
            In more complex environments, this type of testing is automated to accelerate the tests and reduce errors.
