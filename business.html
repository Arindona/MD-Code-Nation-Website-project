  <h1>The purpose of IT in modern business</h1>

  <div class="main">
  <p>The purpose of IT in business are many and varied. <br>
    A vast amount of data is now present in all aspects of business. Information Technology plays a key role in the effective processing of this data to enable a range of activities including:,<br> 
<ul> 
    <li>Product creation</li>
    <li>Collaboration</li>
    <li>Logistics</li>
    <li>Scheduling</li>
    <li> ..... and even the people management</li>
</ul>

    Huang argued “the formula for business success is simple: drive innovation with information technology” [1] citing the ability to solve complex problems, improve decision making, the ability to target the appropriate audience with marketing, resource management and customer support as examples. 
<br>
<br>   
    Suleman extends this argument by the inclusion of the effectiveness and security aspects[2]. He suggests the enablement of effective communication, data protection, readily available knowledge, employee engagement, exploration of new markets and business expansion are all enabled by the appropriate information technology.

    Businesses must recognise the evolution of Information technology also presents a threat. In addition to the internal methods and processes that are enabled by IT, the rapid growth in availability of data has on both the consumer preferences and the increase in competition must not be underestimated. 
<br> 
<br>
    Drucker (2001) predicted the shift in power to the consumers would result from enhancements to data access and connectivity when he commented on  “the simple reason that the customer has full access to  information worldwide” [3]. 
<br>
<br>
    Established businesses must also acknowledge information technology has accelerated innovation and competition from unanticipated sources. Schmidt et al. recognised the alternatives may not only include substitute offerings from new entrants but also the ability to make “previously inconceivable products and services a reality for consumers.” [4]

    The effective use of Information technology is clearly a key differentiator for successful businesses, hence the expansion in the number of roles in this sector.
