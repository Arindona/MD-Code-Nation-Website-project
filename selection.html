    <h1>Factors that influence selection and use of IT systems and software</h1> 
    <p>
    <div class="main">
    The selection of IT systems and software is a project in itself and is highly dependant on the desired outcome. For example, when considering collaboration tools that provide easy access to data and insights, Nicastro[17] suggests tool selection “should not be about the perfect tool, but about the perfect fit for what employees specifically need” and focusing on the challenges and problems to be resolved. 
    <br>
    Forsgen et al [18] demonstrated a positive statistically significant impact on delivery when teams are able to choose their own tools based on what is best for the users. However, The selection of IT systems and software is highly dependant on the environment.

    In large corporations the maintenance and support considerations including data security and interoperability. 
    <br>
    Factors such as funding, interoperability with other systems, security, ongoing maintenance and in some cases corporate policy need to be considered and can constrain the choice of solutions for individuals and teams.

    The use of the kanban board enabled recording of potential tasks in the backlog as they arose to ensure they were captured. 
    <br>
    The subsequent grooming, prioritisation and refinement of items in the backlog created the ‘Ready’ column that allowed focus on the higher priority items that were in a form that could be enacted, for example included a user story and acceptance criteria. 
    <br>
    The ‘in progress column’ shows the items that are being worked on when they are pulled from the ready column. The number of tickets in this column was limited to avoid reducing effectiveness due to multitasking. 
    <br>
    A blocked column was included to ensure visibility of items that could not be completed as a signal for special action. 
    <br>
    Not only was the kanban board a useful scheduling tool, it also provided a focus on getting work from ‘ready’ to ‘done’ with the minimum number of impediments.
    <br>
    Git provides a valuable environment for version control to help manage and keep track of the source code history. Collaboration is enhanced by utilising the GitHub cloud-based hosting service to manage Git repositories and enables  peer code reviews, multiple developers developing code by branching and supports the subsequent integration.

    “HTML” and “CSS” form the building blocks for website design. HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is used to create the content of the page, whilst CSS or Cascade Styling Sheets is used for the style of the website, including the layout, fonts and background.
