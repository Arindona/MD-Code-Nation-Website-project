                <p>
                After a 30 year career as a mechanical engineer in a traditional organisation, where I became an effective leader and transformation agent, I have recognised the need to migrate my skills into the digital space in order to align with the current demands. 
            <br>
            <br>   
                I became agile advocate within the automotive development sector where, as part of the leadership team, I achieved significant improvements in on time delivery, throughput and well-being of the team members by implementing agility at scale. 
            <br>
            <br>      
                Having implemented agility at scale in a range of teams, consistently achieving measurable improvements, I am confident the approach is adaptable and hence applicable to other sectors.

        <p class = "med">
                    I am now looking for new challenges to further expand my experience as a catalyst leader who ensures the focus remains on the lean agile values and principles. I am, however, finding that the lack of digital experience is preventing my transition to other sectors, hence I enrolled on Code Nation coding bootcamp to start this journey.
