    <h1>Methods, skills and resources for sucesful digital projects</h1>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<div class="main">
A problem solving mindset, adaptability and innovative curiosity are the primary prerequisites order to succeed in the fast paced, complex unpredictable world of digital projects.
<br>
<br> 
Whilst experience with specific tools and languages such as JavaScript, Python, PHP and C++ are valuable, it is equally important to be able to migrate from one environment to another given the rapid evolution of digital toolsets.
<br> 
This flexibility is particularly important for operating in different companies or departments as it is common for a standardised tool-set and programming language to be embedded and the ability to transfer between different solutions is essential.
<br>
<br>
<h2>So much more than coding ....</h2>
In addition to the ability to generate reliable efficient code, other skills are also essential in order to create valuable digital projects.

<h3>Problem exploration</h3>
At the initiation of a project, the ability to empathise with the end user in order to identify their true needs can be a differentiator. Methods such as Ideation [5] are useful to reveal insights and unfulfilled needs that even the user may not have previously recognised.
<br>
Having revealed the desired behaviour for the project, the ability to create artifacts such as flow charts, low resolution prototypes is extremely valuable to develop a shared understanding. 
<br>
<br>
The Story mapping process [6] not only enables collaborative problem exploration but also  enables the overall project to be broken down into smaller elements that can be prioritised, developed, demonstrated and adapted following feedback using an agile approach [7]. This approach also supports collaboration and teamwork, which are also beneficial attributes. 
<h3>Planning</h3>
There is a misconception, based on a misinterpretation of the agile manifesto that there is a reduced need for planning for software projects. Effective delivery within a short time frame requires planning and control, but at a level of granularity that matches the time horizon - see 
<a href="planning.html" target="planning">Planning and execution.</a>
<br>
Techniques such as the sprint methodology or scrum[8] enable this at a team level.
