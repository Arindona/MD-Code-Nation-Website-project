            <h2>Content creation</h2>
            The initial content was defined, based around the specific prompts, in a google doc prior to laying out the website. 
            <br>
            This was done so that there was sufficient material available to enable the focus to remain on layout during the website design phase. 
      <br>
            The material was subsequently subject to evolution as the website design matured.
            <br>
            <h2>Layout</h2>
            The questions in Unit 1 reflected discrete elements of content and hence were separated into individual pages so that the reader could select the items of interest from the index or home page.
            <br>

            <h1>Copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h1> 
            All original website content is secured by copyright law, including photographs, designs and written articles. 
            <br>
            Copyright law becomes effective once the work is published and is copyrighted by default. 
            <br>
            The “Fair Use” principle may mean that copyrighted work, may be publically available in some circumstances.
            <br>
            A formally registered copyright offers greater protection and redress.
            <br>
            Like software, some material is offered under licence. In this case specific limitations as to the use are declared as part of the agreement.
            <br>
            The maximum term of imprisonment in the UK for copyright infringement is 6 months and/or a fine of up to £50,000 when convicted in a magistrates court. 
            <br>
            Crown Court convictions can attract upto a 10 year term  and the fine may be unlimited. [20]

            <h1>Taking account of access issues</h1>
            Websites, tools, and technologies should be designed and developed so that people with disabilities can understand, navigate, contribute and interact with them.
            <br>
            Issues to be considered include physical, speech and visual impairments as well as auditory, cognitive neurological conditions [21].
            <br>
            Web design considerations include colour and contrast selection, easily identifiable interactive elements, clear and consistent navigation, provision of transcripts and captions for multimedia and the inclusion of  text as an alternative for images.

<h1>Appropriate file types for websites </h1>
<br>
Selecting the best file format is important as it may affect the way images appear on the website and a poor choice may prevent users seeing the images [21].
<br>
Inappropriate file formats can also have a detrimental effect on page speed.
<br>
<h2>Joint Photographics Expert Group (JPEG) </h2>
These files are a popular choice for photographs as they are capable of containing over 16 million different colours and offer flexible compression when saving. 
<br>
They do however lose a lot of information when saved, hence PNGs or GIFs are a preferred format.
<br>
<h2>Portable Network Graphics (PNG)</h2>
PNGs are suitable for images, graphics and text. 
<br>
They provide control over transparency, and use a lossless compression so the quality is maintained. It must be noted that some web browsers do not support PNGs.
<h2>Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)</h2>
Gifs are suitable for smaller graphics and logos as they are more limited in the number of colours they can contain but can support transparency. GIFs also tend to be much smaller file sizes compared to other formats.
