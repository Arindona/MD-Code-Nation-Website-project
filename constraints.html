<br>
The tremendous capability of the digital environment, including the internet, for data and entertainment could be subject to misuse without regulation, hence there are a number of restrictions as to what can and cannot be done online [19].
<br>
The legal constraints particularly focus on the uploading and downloading of software and other digital content, including music and video. Many items are subject to copyright and digital rights management including limiting conversion or copying media files. 
<br>
Software tends to be licenced as opposed to an outright purchase. This provides licence to use it but not the ownership rights or right to copy it. 
<br>
Licences such as freeware and shareware have fewer restrictions.
<br>
There are also Legal constraints relating to online behaviour including child protection by prohibiting grooming and inappropriate behaviour. Libellous behaviour online carries the same  penalties as its offline equivalent.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>The implications of The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
The protection of personally identifiable data has also received increased attention as its commercial value has been recognised and exploited.
<br>
The General Data Protection Regulation attends to data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area as well as the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. 
<br>
This has directly impacted data privacy and security standards and indirectly influenced the development and improvement of cybersecurity measures and reduced the potential for potential data breaches within many organisations.
